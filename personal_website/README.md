#PERSONAL WEBSITE

Learning Bootstrap and Coding my personal WEBSITE

I am not a designer at ALL; my goto editing software is Microsoft Paint

So I figure why not learn and implement bootstrap on my personal website www.krpnet.com 

So yeah

I know I can learn the coding part quick; still, I'll probably be shit at making the website ascetically pleasing

Wish me luck, I'm going to need it
